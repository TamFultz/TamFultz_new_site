          <h3>Building A Responsive Website</h3>
          <p>Posted by Tamara Fultz on <time datetime="2017-03-25">March 25, 2017</time>.</p>
        </header>
        <p>	For my final project in the <a href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>’s <a href="https://flatironschool.com/programs/online-html-css-certificate-course/">Building Responsive Websites with HTML & CSS</a>, I decided to build a personal portfolio <a href="https://tamfultz.github.io/TamFultz_new_site/">website</a> - admittedly not a singularly exciting idea, but useful in terms of my own career development. It was to have six pages: a home or “about” page, a blog page, a resume page, a page for metadata / linked data resources, a photo gallery (not yet operational), and finally a media page which is basically being used to exhibit a number of multimedia and random assignments from the class.</p>
        <p>	The structure is fairly simple: at top in the header is a navigation bar and below it a “logo” bar with my name, the layout for the body consists of two columns with the one on the left taking up 2/3s of the space and the other column on the right taking up 1/3 of the space, social icons are located in a fixed position on the right, and at bottom of the page is a footer with copyright information.</p>
        <p>	I confess that when it came to the initial planning I really only worked from an outline and throughout the semester I used a To-Do list to mark off my progress on the pages and special features that I intended on adding. If had been creating a more complex site I certainly would have used wireframing tools like <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a> or <a href="https://gomockingbird.com/home">Mockingbird</a>.</p>
        <p>	So let’s discuss my site: the easiest way is probably to walk you through the HTML code on my index page, briefly talk of the other pages, and then walk you through the two CSS pages. I will end with a succinct paragraph on what I liked and disliked about the course and the coding. </p>
        <br>
        <p><img src="images/TamFultzHeader.jpg"></p>
        <br>
        <p>	The image above shows the head element used on all the pages: clearly HTML5 compliant.  The first two <b>link</b> elements are to the <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Font</a> fonts that I used.  The next link is to a minimized file of normalize CSS that you can get at the <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/normalize">cdnjs</a> site: this small CSS file helps browsers render elements more consistently and in line with current standards.  The following link is to my regular CSS style sheet and the link after that to my CSS stylesheet with the media queries.  The <b>script</b> element gives access to a customized Modernizr file: <a href="https://modernizr.com/download?setclasses">Modernizr</a> helps you to build and download a Javascript file that will detect HTML5 and CSS3 features in browsers, which allows the JavaScript to avoid using unimplemented features or has it employ a workaround to use them. Finally, the <b>meta</b> viewport element: the <b>width=device-width</b> part sets the screen width to that of the device  and the <b>initial-scale=1.0</b> sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.  The <b>minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0</b> prevents the devices from zooming in or out  and instead rely on the media query styling to change the layout .</p>
        <p>	The next section of code on my index page is the body with the social icons code positioned at the top: I will be talking more about them when I get to my CSS page, but the links all go to 4 of my social media pages.  The next section is a <b>header</b> element with my “logo” and navigation bar.  I don’t have much to say about the HTML code in these, but that initially I had my navbar set up as an unordered list, but when it came to styling it I had some problems, so instead set it so they could display inline-block. This was much easier and was well-explained in the code along exercise.  Each pages has various <b>section</b> elements for the page’s content. Finally, every page has a <b>footer</b> element with a copyright statement at the bottom.</p>
        <p>	My <b>style.css</b> page has all the general style code for the pages. I must confess that I felt a bit overwhelmed by this stylesheet: as we went along in the exercises I kept adding and taking away from it and I got a bit confused. I recognize that this is one area where good planning in the beginning would have made it easier.  The first section has all my global styles: I wonder if some of them are necessary, but I wanted to be overly cautious in not ignoring some elements. I honestly wish I could tell you while every line is there, but I have long since forgotten… this is why commenting is so important. Lesson learned!  </p>
        <p>	The <b>blog</b> section has the style for my <b>snazzyquote</b> class (<a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/">class, not an id</a>, because I intend to have a quotation in every book review post). I thought it was important to elegantly style these quotes so they were patently set out from the text and they certainly break up the monotony of the text! </p>
        <p>	The <b>resume</b> section has style for the <b>resume-part</b> class:  these are standard resume parts that I wanted to keep very formal. Then I saw some really cool <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_skill_bar.asp">skill bars</a> on some people’s resumes and I Googled to get the style for that.  Hence the <b>skills</b> class: I think the background colors add some liveliness to the page, although one can seriously question how well anyone can assess the percentage of their own skill in a subject area.  </p>
        <p>	Next comes the <b>background</b> section: these are the background colors and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp">gradients</a> with fixes for the older browsers that are used in the header navbar and logo divs. Then the <b>navigation bar</b> section: this was all cut and paste from the assignment, but it basically fixes the navbar at the top, aligns text in center, gives some borders, displays the links inline-block, and assigns style for some CSS <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp">pseudo-classes</a> like <b>a:hover</b> and <b>a: selected.</b> The next two sections are for the table and the comment form: not much to say about these. </p>
        <p>	An important section is that of the <b>fixes</b>: it includes a global fix for the <b>box-sizing</b> property: it resets the box-sizing property to border-box.  This prevents padding and margins from adding to the size of an element. Also included in this section are the styles for the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/">clearfix</a>: the clearfix forces an element to self-clear its children and is used in float layouts.  To show how effective this fix is I was having problems getting things to float, then I noticed I had miss-typed “clearfix”. In addition, I was trying to float columns that weren’t in the same wrapper (this was pointed out by a friend and a Flatiron fellow student).  Once I corrected both those errors the columns floated like a charm!  </p>
        <p>	The next CSS section sets up the style for my two column <b>layout.</b> There is a small section to style the <b>sections</b>.  Then one of my favorite CSS tricks is used in the section for the <b>social icons:</b> here I used some <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp">sprite rollovers</a>. Is it too geeky to say how much I love these things? A sprite image is a collection of smaller images put into a single large image. Here, the smaller images are icons for the various social media sites with a regular and hover variation for each one. The CSS <b>background-position</b> can then be used to reposition the image to show the correct state within the element.  I was elated when I got these to work on my page! </p>
        <p>	The final sections were for my logo, footer, and media queries.  In addition, I added a separate page for my media queries which created the responsive design for the site. I wanted to go over each of my pages, but this post is getting ridiculously long. So let’s sum it up: </p>
        <p>Here are the most important things I learned:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a single typo in your code can horribly mess up an entire page or even an entire site… type carefully, cut & paste carefully ,and use validators when you can’t find the error.</li>
          <li>comment your code as much as possible, so you understand why you did things the way you did much later.</li>
          <li>use more planning up front and not plan as you go.</li>
          <li>using responsive design isn’t nearly as hard as it sounds: using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/">development tools</a> in the browser help show where it the breakpoints are on your pages (although note I still have a problem with the comment form on the Media page and need guidance in correcting it).</li>
          <li>understanding how to use the command line is imperative.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What did I enjoy the most?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a navigation bar that works can be a thing of beauty.</li>
          <li>sprite rollovers are da’ bomb!</li>
          <li>creating websites yourself gives you a sense of control over your own content and ensures that every action is considered.</li>
          <li>learning how to use Git and GitHub was oddly gratifying and made me feel part of a larger web development community.</li>(See my post on <a href="https://gorgonster.wordpress.com/2016/01/17/getting-git-and-github-2/">GitHub</a> on my Wordpress blog!)

        <p>The remarkable thing about Erwin Panofsky was his uncanny ability to pare down the most important aspect of a historical problem to its very core and illuminate the answer with a memorable, succinct phrase; thereby, not just resolving the matter at hand, but offering a mnemonic for all future scholars wishing to discuss the issue.  The prime example of this approach is his theory of <q>disguised symbolism</q> in Netherlandish paintings: a theory that has been attacked over the years and rightly so for being redundant at best, but one that nevertheless initiated a productive trend in the analysis of what was or was not a symbol in Netherlandish art by art historians. In this work Panofsky again tackles an integral historical dilemma (was there or was there not a Renaissance?) and presents a resolution utilizing a tool nominated <q>the principles of disjunction.</q> According to Panofsky the answer to the question is a resounding, <q>Yes, there was indeed a Renaissance,</q> and his answer is predicated on those very principles of disjunction, which will be explained below.</p>
        <p>In Chapter I (Renaissance: Self-Definition or Self-Deceptions) Panofsky laid down the groundwork for his argument in order to answer the questions: 1. Was there a Renaissance? 2. What distinguished it from other revivals of the Middle Ages? Up until 1933 there had been no debate over the theory that a great revival of arts had begun in Italy under the influence of classical models in the 14th century and which lasted up into the 16th century, but his contemporaries had begun to assert that this statement was flawed in that there had been many small revival during the Middle Ages based on classical models.  Indeed, there had been many ties to classical culture (granted a bit attenuated) throughout the Middle Ages, so in the view of those historians perhaps the Renaissance never really occurred.  Here, though, Panofsky redirects the argument by looking at what the Renaissance sources themselves say about the matter. Petrarch is considered to be the first during the Renaissance to conceive of the idea of a contemporary revival based on classical models, his idea is further espoused by others such as Boccaccio, Lorenzo Valla, and all the way to Vasari. Were the Renaissance humanists deceiving themselves? Panofsky thinks not and the answer, he states, lies in the very visible changes as seen in the architecture of Brunelleschi whose structures patently did not rely on the medieval system of structures.</p>
        <p class="snazzyquote"><q>The deepest and most productive effect of the Neo-Platonic <i>Weltanschaung</i> can be observed, however, in poetry - from Girolamo Benivieni to Tasso, Joachim du Bellay, Spenser, Donne, Shaftesbury, Goethe, and Keats - and in the visual arts. Never before had Plato's doctrine of 'divine frenzy', fused with the Aristotelian notion that all outstanding men are melancolics and with the astrological belief in a special connection between the <i>humor melancholicus</i> and the most ill-boding yet highest and most august of the seven Planets, produced the concept of a Saturnian 'genius' pursuing his lonely and perilous path on a high ridge above the multitude and set apart from ordinary mortals by his ability to be 'creative' under divine inspiration.</q> (Panofsky, page 187)</p>
        <p>Having responded to the question of whether there was a Renaissance, in Chapter II (Renaissance and Renascences) goes on to resolve the question of what distinguishes that Renaissance from other similar revivals of the Middle Ages.  Panofsky gives a detailed analysis, amply supported by images and literary quotations, of the Carolingian renovatio, the Ottonian and Anglo-Saxon revivals of 1000 A.D., and a Mediterranean revival occurring in Southern France, Italy, and Spain.  One important phenomenon he notices is that throughout the Middle Ages whenever a work of art borrows its form from a classical model, this form is almost always invested with a Christian significance (interpretatio Christiana); conversely whenever a work of art borrows its theme from classical sources, the theme is invariably presented in a non-classical, contemporary form. Panofsky notes that this principle of disjunction operates even in literature.  One well-known example of this would be Nicolo Pisano’s Fortitude in the Baptistery Pulpit at Pisa whose heroic form was based on an image of Hercules found on a Roman sarcophagus, but the figure represents the Christian virtue of fortitude.   Panofksy proposes that the causes for this disjunction in art are the medieval urge to compartmentalize and an inability to make historical distinctions.  It is these very characteristics that made the medieval artist unable to truly integrate classical ideas into their work. In addition, these early renascences were limited by geographic boundaries and were transitory, while the changes wrought in the Renaissance were total and complete. </p>
        <p>Finally, in Chapter III (I Primi Lumi: Italian Trecento Painting and Its Impact on the Rest of Europe) and Chapter IV (Rinascimento dell’Antichita: The Fifteenth Century), Panofsky offers up further insight into the cultural and intellectual events that brought about these changes.</p>
        <p>Upon publication, this book received overwhelming warm critical reviews from the scholarly community.  Many noted, though, that he didn’t offer anything particularly new: S. Lane Faison states that <q>The final chapter defends a standard view of the Quattrocento, but Panofsky has never been a more illuminating advocate.</q>  And the art historian, James Ackerman, confirms <q>Art historians have said all along that there really was a Renaissance, but Panofsky strengthens the point by analyzing the writers from Petrarch to Vasari.</q>  The shrewdest analysis came from Paul Oskar Kristeller, a scholar of Renaissance philosophy, who after enumerating a number of textual mistakes praises the book’s <q>many noteworthy remarks</q> and Panofsky as a scholar who <q>conceives of his subject as a part and facet of the broader field of intellectual and cultural history.</q>  This, then, is the true genius of Panofsky’s work: that he took a commonplace question (was there a Renaissance?), focused in on the heart of the problem and comprehensively analyzed it through the lens of cultural history.</p>
