        <p>The remarkable thing about Erwin Panofsky was his uncanny ability to pare down the most important aspect of a historical problem to its very core and illuminate the answer with a memorable, succinct phrase; thereby, not just resolving the matter at hand, but offering a mnemonic for all future scholars wishing to discuss the issue.  The prime example of this approach is his theory of <q>disguised symbolism</q> in Netherlandish paintings: a theory that has been attacked over the years and rightly so for being redundant at best, but one that nevertheless initiated a productive trend in the analysis of what was or was not a symbol in Netherlandish art by art historians. In this work Panofsky again tackles an integral historical dilemma (was there or was there not a Renaissance?) and presents a resolution utilizing a tool nominated <q>the principles of disjunction.</q> According to Panofsky the answer to the question is a resounding, <q>Yes, there was indeed a Renaissance,</q> and his answer is predicated on those very principles of disjunction, which will be explained below.</p>
        <p>In Chapter I (Renaissance: Self-Definition or Self-Deceptions) Panofsky laid down the groundwork for his argument in order to answer the questions: 1. Was there a Renaissance? 2. What distinguished it from other revivals of the Middle Ages? Up until 1933 there had been no debate over the theory that a great revival of arts had begun in Italy under the influence of classical models in the 14th century and which lasted up into the 16th century, but his contemporaries had begun to assert that this statement was flawed in that there had been many small revival during the Middle Ages based on classical models.  Indeed, there had been many ties to classical culture (granted a bit attenuated) throughout the Middle Ages, so in the view of those historians perhaps the Renaissance never really occurred.  Here, though, Panofsky redirects the argument by looking at what the Renaissance sources themselves say about the matter. Petrarch is considered to be the first during the Renaissance to conceive of the idea of a contemporary revival based on classical models, his idea is further espoused by others such as Boccaccio, Lorenzo Valla, and all the way to Vasari. Were the Renaissance humanists deceiving themselves? Panofsky thinks not and the answer, he states, lies in the very visible changes as seen in the architecture of Brunelleschi whose structures patently did not rely on the medieval system of structures.</p>
        <p class="snazzyquote"><q>The deepest and most productive effect of the Neo-Platonic <em>Weltanschaung</em> can be observed, however, in poetry - from Girolamo Benivieni to Tasso, Joachim du Bellay, Spenser, Donne, Shaftesbury, Goethe, and Keats - and in the visual arts. Never before had Plato's doctrine of 'divine frenzy', fused with the Aristotelian notion that all outstanding men are melancolics and with the astrological belief in a special connection between the <em>humor melancholicus</em> and the most ill-boding yet highest and most august of the seven Planets, produced the concept of a Saturnian 'genius' pursuing his lonely and perilous path on a high ridge above the multitude and set apart from ordinary mortals by his ability to be 'creative' under divine inspiration.</q> (Panofsky, page 187)</p>
        <p>Having responded to the question of whether there was a Renaissance, in Chapter II (Renaissance and Renascences) goes on to resolve the question of what distinguishes that Renaissance from other similar revivals of the Middle Ages.  Panofsky gives a detailed analysis, amply supported by images and literary quotations, of the Carolingian renovatio, the Ottonian and Anglo-Saxon revivals of 1000 A.D., and a Mediterranean revival occurring in Southern France, Italy, and Spain.  One important phenomenon he notices is that throughout the Middle Ages whenever a work of art borrows its form from a classical model, this form is almost always invested with a Christian significance (interpretatio Christiana); conversely whenever a work of art borrows its theme from classical sources, the theme is invariably presented in a non-classical, contemporary form. Panofsky notes that this principle of disjunction operates even in literature.  One well-known example of this would be Nicolo Pisano’s Fortitude in the Baptistery Pulpit at Pisa whose heroic form was based on an image of Hercules found on a Roman sarcophagus, but the figure represents the Christian virtue of fortitude.   Panofksy proposes that the causes for this disjunction in art are the medieval urge to compartmentalize and an inability to make historical distinctions.  It is these very characteristics that made the medieval artist unable to truly integrate classical ideas into their work. In addition, these early renascences were limited by geographic boundaries and were transitory, while the changes wrought in the Renaissance were total and complete. </p>
        <p>Finally, in Chapter III (I Primi Lumi: Italian Trecento Painting and Its Impact on the Rest of Europe) and Chapter IV (Rinascimento dell’Antichita: The Fifteenth Century), Panofsky offers up further insight into the cultural and intellectual events that brought about these changes.</p>
        <p>Upon publication, this book received overwhelming warm critical reviews from the scholarly community.  Many noted, though, that he didn’t offer anything particularly new: S. Lane Faison states that <q>The final chapter defends a standard view of the Quattrocento, but Panofsky has never been a more illuminating advocate.</q>  And the art historian, James Ackerman, confirms <q>Art historians have said all along that there really was a Renaissance, but Panofsky strengthens the point by analyzing the writers from Petrarch to Vasari.</q>  The shrewdest analysis came from Paul Oskar Kristeller, a scholar of Renaissance philosophy, who after enumerating a number of textual mistakes praises the book’s <q>many noteworthy remarks</q> and Panofsky as a scholar who <q>conceives of his subject as a part and facet of the broader field of intellectual and cultural history.</q>  This, then, is the true genius of Panofsky’s work: that he took a commonplace question (was there a Renaissance?), focused in on the heart of the problem and comprehensively analyzed it through the lens of cultural history.</p>
